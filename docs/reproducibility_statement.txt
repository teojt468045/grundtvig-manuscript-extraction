All data processing and analysis procedures used in this study are fully reproducible. The XML source files from Registranten constitute a stable corpus, and the metadata extraction pipeline is implemented in a self-contained Python notebook (datering_registranten_sidetal_FINAL.ipynb) that performs all steps deterministically. The script parses each XML document; extracts dating information, page and leaf counts, bibliographic numbers, and fascicle identifiers; maps fascicle numbers to fourteen archival categories; and exports the resulting dataset as a well-structured Excel file. Because the pipeline operates exclusively through rule-based parsing and does not rely on any stochastic components or external online services, repeated execution of the notebook on the same XML corpus will yield identical results.

All logic for year detection, numerical extraction (including treatment of ranges such as “1–10”), leaf-to-page fallbacks, and category assignment is explicitly defined in the code and documented within the notebook. The full workflow—from raw XML to the final analytical dataset and visualisations—can therefore be reproduced by running the notebook in any standard Python environment with the required libraries installed. The transparency of the computational pipeline ensures that future researchers may verify, replicate, or extend the analyses presented here.
